The KS-equation:
- Because it contains both second- and fourth-order derivatives, it produces complex behaviour.
- The second-order term acts as an energy source and has a destabilizing effect.
- The nonlinear term transfers energy from low to high wavenumbers.
- The fourth-order term has a stabilizing effect.
- It is a PDE that can exhibit chaotic solutions.

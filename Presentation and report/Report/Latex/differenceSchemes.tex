\subsection{Explicit method}
The KS-equation can be approximated by using central differences in space, and forward differences in time, also known as the Euler's method. Notice that the mean operator was used on the nonlinear term to avoid half space steps.    The nonlinear term has also been rewritten from $uu_x$ to $\frac{1}{2}(u^2)_x$. The following discretizations,
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
u_t &\approx \frac{\Delta u}{k} = \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{k} \\
u_{xx} &\approx \frac{\delta^2 u}{h^2} = \frac{u_{m+1}-2u_{m}+u_{m-1}}{h^2} = \frac{1}{h^2}Au \\
u_{xxxx} &\approx \frac{\delta^4 u}{h^4} = \frac{u_{m+2}-4u_{m+1}+6u_m-4u_{m-1}+u_{m-2}}{h^4} = \frac{1}{h^4}A^2u\\
(u^2)_{x} &\approx \frac{\mu \delta u^2}{h} = \frac{(u_{m+1})^2-(u_{m-1})^2}{2h} = \frac{1}{2h}D,\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

lead to an explicit scheme:

\begin{equation}
\label{explDiff}
U^{n+1} = (I - \frac{k}{h^2}A - \frac{k}{h^4}A^2)U^n - \frac{k}{4h}D(U^{n}\odot U^n).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Implicit-explicit method}
The explicit method requires very small time steps for an acceptable precision in space, so for better stability it is an option to look at the Crank-Nicolson's formula. Applying the trapezoidal rule to all linear terms gives a Crank-Nicolson-type method which is implicit-explicit. The nonlinear term is approximated to be the same as in the explicit method \eqref{explDiff}.
\begin{align}
\label{implDiff}
(I + \frac{k}{2h^2}A + \frac{k}{2h^4}A^2)U^{n+1}
= (I - \frac{k}{2h^2}A - \frac{k}{2h^4}A^2)U^n - \frac{k}{4h}D(U^{n}\odot U^n)
\end{align}

By what we have seen from the numerical experiments, when comparing the two difference schemes, the implicit scheme shows better properties regarding stability than the explicit scheme. For the latter a stability criterion for the time step, $k/h^4 \le 1/8$, was given under some assumptions, but this time step is very low and unpractical. For the implicit method, we were not able to give any analytic reasonable criterion, but numerical testing implied stability for time steps smaller than $\frac{1}{3}$. Though the numerical computations are much more time consuming for the implicit method, due to the stiffness and instability of the system, this method would serve better in practice for modeling this equation.

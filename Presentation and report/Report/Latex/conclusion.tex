By what we have seen from our numerical experiments, when comparing our two difference schemes, the implicit scheme shows better properties regarding stability than the explicit scheme. For the latter we were able to give a stability criterion for the time step under some assumptions, but this time step was very low and unpractical. For the implicit method, we were not able to give any analytic reasonable criterion, but numerical testing implied stability for time steps smaller than $\frac{1}{3}$. Though the numerical computations are much more time consuming for the implicit method, due to the stiffness and instability of the system, this method would serve better in practice for modelling this equation.

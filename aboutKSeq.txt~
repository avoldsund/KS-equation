The KS-equation:
- Because it contains both second- and fourth-order derivatives, it produces complex behaviour.
- The second-order term acts as an energy source and has a destabilizing effect.
- The nonlinear term transfers energy from low to high wavenumbers.
- The fourth-order term has a stabilizing effect.
- It is a PDE that can exhibit chaotic solutions.
- Possible to use a EDTRK4 method to solve the problem, i.e. Expoential Time Differencing Runge-Kutta 4 method. Solving the problem in the Fourier space.
- RK4 is considered THE Runge-Kutta method. It is a fourth order method, i.e. the local truncation error is on the order O(h^5), while the total accumulated error is order O(h^4).
- "The authors found that the higher order ETD based schemes can be several orders
of magnitude faster than low-order Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) [87] methods." Nottingham thesis.
- "The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, which we will refer to as the K-S equation, is
one of the simplest PDEs capable of describing complex (chaotic) behavior in both
time and space." Nottingham
- "In physical terms, this equation describes reaction diffusion problems, and the dynamics of viscous-fluid films flowing along walls, and was introduced by Sivashinsky [74] as a model of laminar flame-front instabilities and by Kuramoto [50] as a model of phase turbulence in chemical oscillations."
